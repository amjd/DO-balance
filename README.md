DO-balance
==========

A python script to find the remaining balance on DigitalOcean.
Although DigitalOcean does have an API, it has no endpoint to get the current balance. So this is a scratch-my-own-itch solution I put together which tries to fill in on the missing feature.

###Instructions:
1. Edit the file to add your username and password. (You might want to use environment variables.)
2. Run `$ python DObal.py`
